<center><b>Ride Safe</b> is a simple game similar to the classic Brick Racer.</center> 
 
 To create a simultaneous multiplayer Racing game similar to the classic Brick Racer game, where a car has to drive safe through the busy roads and avoid colliding with the cars and obstacles coming through the tracks. With increased level, the speed at which the vehicles are moving towards the player increases.

## Features
* The underlying structure of the game will be a racing game where our player operates a car token which can move sideways and dodge the vehicles that are coming through the tracks from the opposite direction.
* As the level increases, the speed of the vehicles approaching from opposite direction will increase making it harder to tackle the car.
* The maximum level of the game is not decided yet but it can be up to level 25 during which the opposing cars will have tremendous speed making it very hard for the player to easily win.
* The player will have three lives, each one will be deducted after every collision. When the player runs out of lives, its Game Over.
* It will be a multiplayer game with a simultaneous display  
* If one player dies (game over), then the score of the remaining will be compared and WINNER will be selected.
* The game starts auto but you cannot play unless you CLICK on the player token
* Level up takes place with every +10 increment in the Score
