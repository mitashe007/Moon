<center><b>CBM</b> is an international Christian development organization, committed to improving the quality of life of people with disabilities in the poorest communities of the world.
</center> 
 
 They arrange for seminars, workshops to raise awareness and help people with disabilities in many possible ways.
CBM is the organization we chose to study for the final project of System Analysis Design (SAD) course.
 
##Introduction

Systems design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. Systems design could be seen as the application of systems theory to product development.

## Features of our system

* Website with Member log-in system : Admin, Users & Guest
* Sign up: Admin approval required for a person to become a member
* Log in : Multiple logins at a time is NOT allowed
* Database with access control : Guests can NOT see the members list, 
they can only see the organization history etc and Events list, 
in order to join an event they have to have membership. 
Users have access to members list however they cannot edit any member’s profile other than their own. 
* Admin Panel : Admin has control over everything. 
Can approve/delete members. 
Can create/modify/delete events, announcements and organization history. 
They can generate Donation/Registration reports, etc.   
* Google Calendar Integration : Used for sending emails / sms to clients for free of cost
* Members can join an Event by registering for it
* Online Payment System (for events/Donation)
* Comments sector : Visitors can drop comments
* Contact Us : There’s a Contact Form which allows Direct email option
* Additional Features: Get announcements via ticker, etc.
     
Before we started working on the project, we studied the different SDLC Methodologies and decided that Prototyping Methodology is the most suitable type for our project since it provides ease-of-change, is not a standalone, involves users more and provides small-scale mockups to the user for feedback.
After that we completed a Feasibility Study evaluating the Technical, Economical, Organizational Feasibility to analyze the ability of completing our project successfully and we received satisfactory results to move forward with our project.
Then we moved on to the Requirements Analysis sector where we prepared a Requirement Specification from businessperson perspective laying out functional and non-functional requirements of the system.
Our next approach was to decide on the Requirements Gathering methodology in order to collect and integrate information from the right people. After analysis the techniques, we found that Joint Application Development (JAD) was the most suitable approach for our project.
In this report we are going into the details of System Design by discussing about the System Architecture, Software Architecture, I/O Procedures, UI. We will also include EER diagram and Schema to explain the Database details. In addition we will include Class Diagram and also state how our project has met most of its non-functional and functional requirements.

## System Architecture

For the Hardware Platform, we will need the following to run our system:
* Server PC
* Client Device (PC, Mobile, etc)
* Routers, Switches, Hubs
* DSL Cable, Modems, Telephones (depending on the type of Network)
* Printers (optional)

For the Software Platform, we will need the following to run our system: 
* Web Server Operating System
* File Server & Database Server Operating System
* Browsers compatible with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL

## How Non-Functional Requirements were met:
* Operational  Requirements 
Allows the customers to communicate and get reply fast :  Direct Contact option
* Printing option  : done
* Retrieval (download) from archives by authority on demand (from archives) : Subscribe
* Store sent, draft and incoming emails : via gmail 
* Security
 Access to the main database will  not be allowed for guest : User’s will only have access to their profile info
* User’s information will be secured through “username” and “password” : done in the login sec
* Store and match the log-in security info : done
* Cash transfer progress report notification on mobile phones and email (preferably Bkash) : done
* Performance
Retrieval of data from archives made fast : single sql query does the trick
* Store and auto remind events from calendar on mobile phones and emails within seconds : via Google Calendar
Cultural and Political 
* No special cultural and political requirements are anticipated. 


## How Functional Requirements were met:

*	Login : Two types of members login system along with Guest access
*	 Archive : A Page containing all previous events record
*	 Edit Calendar : via Google Calendar
*	 Send Email : via Gmail
*	 Send SMS notification: via Google Calendar
*	 Edit data : accessing Database
*	 Online Payment (Register/donate) : bKash 
*	 Printing : enabled
