Seoul was the third host following London and Budapest and continued its contribution to the previous themes. As South Korea hosted the third edition, it continued efforts to develop the longstanding themes such as Economic Growth and Development, Social and Cultural Benefits, a Safe and Secure Cyberspace, Cybercrime and International Security. But it also sought to expand the borders of the Cyber-conference by including developing countries from the Global South. With approximately 1.600 delegates from 87 countries, 18 international and regional organizations, as well as research centres and private enterprises, the Seoul Conference considerably increased the scale of the Global Conference on CyberSpace. With a wider participation it introduced “Capacity Building” as a new theme in order to address the digital divide between developed and developing countries.

The Seoul Conference produced the Seoul Framework for and Commitment to Open and Secure Cyberspace, a comprehensive document that summarizes the discussions in the international community and provides a way forward for future dialogue.  The Framework states that international law must be applied to cyberspace and offers guidelines for governments and international organisations on coping with cybercrime and cyberwar. It highlights the importance of boosting internet access, particularly for developing countries, but also for education, innovation, economic development and to ensure a free flow of information.
