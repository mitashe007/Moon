Attended the Programming contest representing BRAC University. We were a team of 3 members and called ourselves the "BRACU Sentinels". We made the youngest team from BRACU to have been selected via the Online Selection round and we managed to be through to the second round by solving atleast two problems within the given time slot. Unfortunately, we could not proceed to the next round since we lacked the necessary time management skills. Nevertheless, it was a good experience, one we learned much from.
