## Wall Magazine

TARC stands for Training And Resource Center. It is mandatory for all Undergraduate students of BRAC University to complete a Residential semester at their campus located in Savar, Bangladesh. The goal of the program is to develop proficiency in English, enhance leadership skills, instill a strong sense of ethical and social responsibility to apt the students to face challenges of higher education.

As a part of the program, each student must be involved in at least one extracurricular activity from a list of activities such a learning a new language, drama club, book reading club, wall magazine, etc. 

In my TARC days, I got involved with Wall Magazine. All throughout the semester we worked on the Wall Magazine which was to be displayed at the final cultural night of the semester. There were five boards categorized and named as Dorm at Night, Sports and Culture, Captured Memories, Experiences and the Fun Zone. Each board has a leader to manage and decide the objectives. Me and my team worked with the Fun Zone where we essentially put cartoons, songs, poems, jokes and funny incidents of the semester.
