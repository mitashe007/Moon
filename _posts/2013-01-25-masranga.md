I participated at a TV program among the team representing BRAC University at IUB Campus. The program was aired on Masranga Television with live question/answer session among the present students of private/public universities and were answered by some of the famous politicians of the country.
The goal of the program was to get perspectives of the youth on student politics and to discuss the expectations,demands and shortcomings in the field in addition to fitting politics alongside education.
