When I was 22, I climbed Keokradong. Not metaphorically—I literally climbed the third highest peak of Bangladesh (3,235 ft.).

We took a rather difficult route from Pukurpara to direct Keokradong at one go. While I was hiking, I was injured and I thought about quitting approximately 1,000 times. (And that’s a lowball estimate.) But despite the sprained feet, scorching heat, mental and physical fatigue, and trail complexity, I kept going. Better yet, I kept leading the group. (As I was the Vice President of the team.) I’m that person. Once I say I’ll do something, it will happen.

Now, I put that perseverance to work as I handle any project. I don’t have to climb any mountains…but sometimes I do have to move them.

While I can (and often do) work well alone, but I’m at my best collaborating with others. I’m well-versed in planning and development, research, project management and communication.

When I’m not working, I love to sketch, play video games (mostly racing), work my way through random recipe tryouts, but most importantly I love exploring new places and gathering new experiences.
